note: 
install mongo doesn't work

first, brew install mongo doesn't work, follow instructions here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

then mkdir and sudo chown doesn't work, follow instructions here: https://zellwk.com/blog/install-mongodb/

then, to start mongo - mongodb doesn't work, use: brew services run mongodb-community

## aim

build a simple thing in an hour or two...

get my eye in with express basics and connecting to a db.
