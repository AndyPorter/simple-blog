## aim

build a simple thing in an hour or two...

get my eye in with express basics and connecting to a db.


this may lead on to a larger idea i have...

express and postgres or reddis - something that heroko supports - either to make a blog or to buid an app that requires a db for storage - e.,g maybe a personal site, blog and projects, or something else.
