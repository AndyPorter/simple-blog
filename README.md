note: 
install mongo doesn't work

first, brew install mongo doesn't work, follpw instructions here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

then mk dir and sudo chown doesn't work, follow instructions here: https://zellwk.com/blog/install-mongodb/

then, to start mongo - mongodb doesn't work, use: brew services run mongodb-community

## aim

build a simple thing in an hour or two...

get my eye in with express basics and connecting to a db.


this may lead on to a larger idea i have...

express and postgres or reddis - something that heroko supports - either to make a blog or to buid an app that requires a db for storage - e.,g maybe a personal site, blog and projects, or something else.
